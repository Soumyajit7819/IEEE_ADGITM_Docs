# Arduino Platform

The Arduino UNO is the best board to get started with electronics and coding. 

`If this is your first experience tinkering with the platform, the UNO is the most robust board you can start playing with. The UNO is the most used and documented board of the whole Arduino family.`

## Main Features

Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. 

* It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. 
* It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. 

You can tinker with your UNO without worrying too much about doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again.

## Downloading Arduino IDE

Before starting, make sure you have the latest version of the Arduino IDE installed in your computer.

* Refer to the downloads section on this link at [Downloads section](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

:::warning Be Carefull

Don't Download `Arduino IDE 2.0xx` now, as it is relatively new and currently not stable, also it is little heavy for PC's with low specs. So `Arduino IDE 1.xx` version in recommended

:::

* Or you could directly download by clicking this link [Arduino IDE 1.X](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.19-windows.exe)

* Alternaltively you could also download it from Microsoft Windows Store on this link [Microsoft Store Link](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4rsd8?ocid=badge)
