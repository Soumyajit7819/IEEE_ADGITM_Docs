# Representation of Binary Data
Information is stored on the computer in binary form. A binary bit can exist in one of two possible states.  
In positive logic, the presence of a voltage is called the `‘1’, true, asserted, or high state`. The absence of a voltage is called the `‘0’, false,  not asserted, or low state`.

Given figure shows the output of a typical complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit.  
> The left side shows the condition with a true bit, and the right side shows a false. 

The output of each digital circuit consists of a p-type transistor “on top of” an n-type transistor. In digital circuits, each transistor is essentially on or off. 
* If the transistor is on, it is equivalent to a short circuit between its two output pins. 
* Conversely, if the transistor is off, it is equivalent to an open circuit between its outputs pins.
