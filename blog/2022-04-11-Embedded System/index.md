Given the sudden rise in the demand and importance of Embedded System, `IEEE PES ADGITM` is organizing an SIG on `Introduction to Embedded Systems Design` for our IEEE members who want to do something tech related that will benefit them in the longer run.ðŸ”¥

ðŸŽ¯ In this SIG we will explain you the basics of the Embedded Systems. You will start from a beginner's level and will soon realize why this skill is so appealing to recruiters.

Don't worry, the SIG won't be completely theoretical. This SIG will provide you with the practical skills and confidence required to build your own embedded system using the popular and affordable Arduino UNO development board and also basic understanding into the world of embedded system. We will give some cool practical demos too.ðŸ˜‰

So mark your calendars!!

**ðŸ“… Date: 18th April 2022**  
**ðŸ•– Time: 2:30 P.M- 5:30 P.M**  
**ðŸ’» Venue: IEEE MAKER'S SPACE**
