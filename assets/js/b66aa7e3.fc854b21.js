You will start from a beginner\'s level and will soon realize why this skill is so appealing to recruiters.\\n\\nDon\'t worry, the SIG won\'t be completely theoretical. This SIG will provide you with the practical skills and confidence required to build your own embedded system using the popular and affordable Arduino UNO development board and also basic understanding into the world of embedded system. We will give some cool practical demos too.\ud83d\ude09\\n\\nSo mark your calendars!!\\n\\n**\ud83d\udcc5 Date: 18th April 2022**  \\n**\ud83d\udd56 Time: 2:30 P.M- 5:30 P.M**  \\n**\ud83d\udcbb Venue: IEEE MAKER\'S SPACE**  \\n**Note: This Is Exclusively For IEEE Members**\\n\\n\\nThanks & Regards,  \\nSoumyajit Das  \\nPES Chairperson  \\nIEEE ADGITM"}]}')}}]);
